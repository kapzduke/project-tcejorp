# Project Tcejorp
A mod that adds planets. Yeeaaaah.

All and any things you see are subject to change.
# The Main Balls of Dirt
**Gaptika**

![icon-gaptika](https://github.com/kapzduke/project-tcejorp/blob/master/icon-gaptika.png)

A more TD-oriented Erekir with an alternative playstyle. Gets sillier as the endgame approaches.

**Inomal**

![icon-inomal](https://github.com/kapzduke/project-tcejorp/blob/master/icon-inomal.png)

The single-ore TD planet. High resource supplies and demands will make you use every tile of space.

**Ognadnaf**

![icon-ognadnaf](https://github.com/kapzduke/project-tcejorp/blob/master/icon-ognadnaf.png)

Moon of Gaptika. Very inconvenient gameplay, but plays the strongest role in mixtech.
